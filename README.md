# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Deer404 and I'm a front-end developer based in China/ShenZhen.
Although I'm currently a front-end developer, my personal goal is to become a skilled full-stack web engineer. In my free time, I'm learning Go and exploring other back-end technologies to complement my front-end skills.

## About Me

I'm passionate about building responsive and visually appealing web applications using the latest technologies in the front-end space. My skills can be divided into work-related skills and personal interests:
