# Hey there! 👋

My name is Deer404 and I'm a front-end developer based in China/ShenZhen.
Although I'm currently a front-end developer, my personal goal is to become a skilled full-stack web engineer. In my free time, I'm learning Go and exploring other back-end technologies to complement my front-end skills.

## About Me

I'm passionate about building responsive and visually appealing web applications using the latest technologies in the front-end space. My skills can be divided into work-related skills and personal interests:

### Work-related skills:

- React and Vue (I use react for work, but usually prefer Vue.)
- Nest.js, Egg.js, Koa, and Express
- Flutter
- React Native

### Personal interests:

- Python(Only used for developing web crawlers, for learning purposes.)
- Dart with Flutter(Used to develop an app)
- Minecraft plugin (Just a little bit)
- Unity or Godot (Always interested in game development)
- angular(Because I have used nestjs to develop the backend, I want to try angular,Not yet used.)
- more...
### 

I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies to enhance my skills as a developer.

## My GitHub Projects
